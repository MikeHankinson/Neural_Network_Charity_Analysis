# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis 
Implement a neural network, using the TensorFlow platform in Python, to model (train and test) a dataset containing 34,000 organizations that have previously recieved funding. The model output is a binary classifier capable of predicting successful donation outcomes.  

## Data Sources and Coding Files
Data for analysis was provided within the attached ([CSV file). ](/Resources/charity_data.csv)

Statistical analysis was performed in Python and is attached:  [AlphabetSoupCharity](AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb), and [AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization](AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb).

The data contained the following features:
- APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
- AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
- CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
- USE_CASE—Use case for funding
- ORGANIZATION—Organization type
- STATUS—Active status
- INCOME_AMT—Income classification
- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
- ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested

The folloiwng was the target variable:
- IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

The following two columns were removed from the model because they were simply identifications for the features.  
- EIN and NAME—Identification columns



## Results

![Fig_1](MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/Screenshots/Linear_Regression_MPG.PNG)

Performed a multiple linear regression to determine the effect of the following 5 measured variables on fuel efficiency (measured in mpg): vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance and drive train (AWD or not).  

The best-fit model is described by the following:  MPG = 6.267xvehicle_length + 0.001245xvehicle_weight +0.06887xspoiler_angle 3.546xground_clearance - 3.411xAWD - 104.

Analyzing the model's coefficients (inputs), we find that vehicle length and ground clearance have a statistically significant impact on fuel economy (MPG).  Therefore, with this knowledge, we know the slope of the model is not zero because the individual contributors to the model's slope (6.267xvehicle_length and 3.546xground_clearance) are significant and non-zero.  

Although, the analysis with 5 predictors does model fuel economy fairly well (r-squared = 0.7149), it appears the model is not complete.  It is likely that other unmeasured predictors (variables) contribute to fuel economy as well.  

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

![Fig_2](MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/Screenshots/Suspension_central_tendancy.PNG)

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 psi. The above analysis demonstrates that, with a variance of 62.29 psi, the aggregate falls within design specification.  


![Fig_3](MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/Screenshots/Suspension_by_Lot.PNG)

Both Lot 1 and 2 meet design specification.  However, Lot 3 is well outside suspension coil specification with a variance of 170.29 psi (> 100 psi).  

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

![Fig_4](MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/Screenshots/ttest_PSI_allLots.PNG)

A random subset sample of 50 data points (150 full population) were obtained (Using sample_n function) to determine if there is a statistical difference between the sample mean PSI and that of the population across all manufacturing lots.  Using a one sample t-test, we obtained a p-value = 0.8831.  Assuming a significance level is the common 0.05%, the p-value (0.8831) is above the significance level.  Therefore, there is not sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and there is no statistical difference between the observed sample mean and the presumed population mean.  

The same analysis was performed (below) for each individual lot as well.  

![Fig_5](MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/Screenshots/ttest_PSI_Lot1.PNG)

Lot 1:  Assuming a significance level is the common 0.05%, the p-value (0.0004297)  is below the significance level.  Therefore, there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. There is a statistical difference between the observed sample mean and the presumed population mean of Lot 1.  


![Fig_6](MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/Screenshots/ttest_PSI_Lot2.PNG)

Lot 2:  Assuming a significance level is the common 0.05%, the p-value (0.08261) is above the significance level.  Therefore, there is not sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.  There is no statistical difference between the observed sample mean and the presumed population mean in Lot 2.  


![Fig_7](MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/Screenshots/ttest_PSI_Lot3.PNG)

Lot 3:  Assuming a significance level is the common 0.05%, the p-value (0.8442) is above the significance level.  Therefore, there is not sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.  There is no statistical difference between the observed sample mean and the presumed population mean in Lot 3.  

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

Literature provides many methodologies to determine car performance.  The following model is describes a possible methodology to compare performance. The results of the model should be dove-tailed into pricing metrics.  

### Metrics: Metric (variables of study, defined in Variables of Study)
- Fuel Efficiency (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11)
- Safety Rating (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11)
- Cost (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
- Maintenance Cost (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11)

### Variables of Study
1. Vehicle Width
2. Vehicle Height
3. Vehicle Weight
4. Ground Clearance
5. Maximum Power
